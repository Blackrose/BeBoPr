BeBoPr
======

This is the 3D printer controller software for the [BeagleBone](http://beagleboard.org/) with [BeBoPr Cape](http://circuitco.com/support/index.php?title=BeBoPr_Cape). As of 17-06-2012, the software here is operational and it controls my Prusa 3D-printer as can be seen [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfPLskLrslA&feature=youtu.be). For now it will remain a pre-release version until more people have tested it and the initial bugs have been removed.

For more information see the [wiki](https://github.com/modmaker/BeBoPr/wiki/Home-of-the-BeBoPr) pages.
